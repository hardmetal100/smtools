A friend found a solution.

in grub.cfg
****
terminal_output gfxterm
if [ "${recordfail}" = 1 ]; then
set timeout=-1
****
-1 should be 0 .

It works.

Now the only problem is that in case of kernel update, it will execute update-grub I think, which will overwrite this change. It is not that big problem.
