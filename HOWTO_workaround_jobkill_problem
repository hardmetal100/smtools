DELETE OF JOBS DOES NOT WORK WITH GNOME
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669679

I found a work-around:

1. Open /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.

  sudo nano /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

2. There should be two instances of "JobPrivateValues default". Change them to
"JobPrivateValues none". Save and close.

3. Then, restart cups:

  sudo restart cups
